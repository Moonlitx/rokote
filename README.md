# rokote

How to start:

-First you should have latest version of Node. 
-Then you go to backend folder and first install package to json file, type npm install and then install nodemon typing npm install -g nodemon.
-After that you open another terminal for frontend and go to the frontend folder. There you should do also npm install and then npm start to start the app.

App is using MongoDB database and there is .env file which include the password and username to the database. Hopefully it works that way. 

Rokote app is created to see vaccination orders, vaccinations, healthcare districts and many more. There is still several things to do and this is still in progress.
